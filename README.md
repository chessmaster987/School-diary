Web-based information system for managing school processes: students, teachers, classes, schedules, homework, and grades.

This project was developed as a **course project in "Database Organization"**.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

The goal of this project is to design and implement an information system that:

* simplifies the educational process
* provides centralized data management
* ensures role-based access for different users

---

## 👥 User Roles

The system supports 3 types of users:

### 👨‍💼 Administrator

* Manage students, teachers, classes, and subjects
* Create and edit schedules
* Assign teachers to subjects
* View statistics of teacher activity

### 👨‍🏫 Teacher

* Add homework and comments
* Publish announcements
* Conduct lessons (assign grades, attendance)
* View student performance and statistics

### 👨‍🎓 Student

* View homework
* Check grades and comments
* View schedule
* Read announcements

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system is built using a **three-tier architecture**:

1. **Presentation Layer** – HTML templates (Jinja2)
2. **Application Layer** – Flask backend
3. **Data Layer** – PostgreSQL database

Additionally, the project follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** pattern:

* **Model** → Database
* **View** → HTML templates
* **ViewModel** → Flask routes and logic

---

## 🧠 Database Design

The database includes the following main entities:

* `student`
* `teacher`
* `classes`
* `subject`
* `schedule`
* `timetable`
* `grade`
* `homework`
* `homework_comment`
* `notification`

### 🔗 Relationships

* One-to-many relationships (e.g. student → grades)
* Conditional relationships (e.g. class teacher)

The database structure is defined in:

```bash
database/schema.sql
```

## 📦 Installation

### 1. Clone repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chessmaster987/School-diary.git
cd School-diary
```

---

### 2. Create virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

---

### 3. Activate environment

**Windows:**

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**Linux/Mac:**

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

---

### 4. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🐘 Database Setup (PostgreSQL)

### Create database

```sql
CREATE DATABASE "Bazu Danych";
```

---

### Import schema

```bash
psql -U connection_user -d "Bazu Danych" -f database/schema.sql
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

Database connection is defined in `app.py`.

Example:

```python
connection = {
    "database": "Bazu Danych",
    "user": "connection_user",
    "password": "connection_user",
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": "5432"
}
```

---

## ▶️ Running the App

```bash
python app.py
```

Open in browser:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```
